//To determine if a string containing brackets is valid, use a stack. Traverse the string character by character. 
//Push all open brackets ('(', '{', '[') onto the stack. When encountering a closing bracket (')', '}', ']'), check if 
//the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the corresponding open bracket. 
//If it does, pop the stack; otherwise, the string is invalid. At the end, if the stack is empty, the string is valid; 
//otherwise, it is invalid. This ensures brackets are correctly paired and ordered.
